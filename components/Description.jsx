      The idea here is really straightforward. The web app is simply asking the <a className="link link-primary" href="https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/completion/prompt-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">OpenAI text completion API</a> to explain your input in simple terms.

      Now, why did I build this? Great question! Mostly, I just love to mess around with prototypes and deploy little hacks so that I can use cool new tech. But in this case, in addition to using new tools, I often wanna just ask chatgpt to explain something in simple terms, and this site gives me a blazingly fast and easy way to do so without having to authenticate first!
